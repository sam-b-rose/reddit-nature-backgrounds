#Reddit Nature Backgrounds for Mac

##Caveats:
**Setup shell script coming soon**
Still working on better documentation.

##Installation
1. Copy the launch agent script into your '~/Library/LaunchAgents/' folder
2. Create a new folder called 'Scripts' in you root Application folder, so 'Applications/Scripts/'
3. Copy the get_images.py script into the newly created scripts folder
4. Create a new Folder in your '~/Pictures' folder called Backgrounds
5. run 'launchctl load Library/LaunchAgents/com.reddit.backgrounds.plist' terminal to load the agent
6. In system settings, point your Desktop backgrounds to the new '~/Pictures/Backgrounds' folder where the images will be stored
